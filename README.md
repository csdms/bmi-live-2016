# BMI: Live!

Code for the **BMI: Live!** clinic
held at the
[2016 CSDMS Annual Meeting](http://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/Form:CSDMS_annual_meeting),
May 17-19, in Boulder, Colorado.

## The Goal

Given a model, wrap it in a BMI in realtime.
We also hope show some best practices in Python development.

## The Plan

1. Start with a script defining the heat equation model
1. Convert the script to a module (first a function, then a class)
1. Make the module into a package
1. View the list of BMI methods, and their signatures,
   at http://bmi-forum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
1. Together, implement the BMI methods for our model!
1. Test the results in a Jupyter Notebook (and make a plot,
   maybe using widgets!)

## The Requirements

* Laptop
* Text editor
* Python distribution (we recommend the Anaconda Python 2.7 distribution)
* Optionally, a GitHub account, and `git` or GitHub Desktop
