"""Solve the heat equation of a uniform rectilinear grid.

Solve the heat equation of a rectilinear grid with shape (*GRID_NY*,
*GRID_NX*) and row and column spacing (*GRID_DY*, *GRID_DX*). The thermal
conductivity is given by *ALPHA*.

In cartesian coordinates, the heat equation is the following parabolic
differential equation,

    del u / del t - alpha (del^2 u / del x^2 + del^2 u / del y^2) = 0

This becomes the following finite-difference problem,

    Delta u = alpha Delta t ((u_i-1,j + u_i+1,j) / Delta x^2 +
                             (u_i,j-1 + u_i,j+1) / Delta y^2 -
                             2 u_i,j / (Delta x^2 + Delta y^2))
